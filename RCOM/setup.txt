1. Copy your linklayer.c file and any auxiliary .c files (if any) into the "protocol/" folder.
2. Compile the application and the virtual cable program using the provided Makefile.
3. Run the virtual cable program (either by running the executable manually or using the makefile target):
	$ ./cable_app
	$ make run_cable
4. Test the protocol
	4.1 Run the receiver (either by running the executable manually or using the Makefile target):
		$ ./application_main /dev/ttyS11 rx penguin-received.gif
		$ make run_tx
	4.2 Run the transmitter (either by running the executable manually or using the Makefile target):
		$ ./application_main /dev/ttyS10 tx penguin.gif
		$ make run_rx
	4.3 Should have received a nice looking penguin. You can check if both files are the same using the diff Linux command, or using the Makefile target:
		$ diff -s penguin.gif penguin-received.gif
		$ make check_files
5. Test the protocol with cable unplugging and noise
	5.1. Run receiver and transmitter again
	5.2. Quickly move to the cable program console and press 0 for unplugging the cable, 2 to add noise, and 1 to normal
	5.3. Should have received a nice looking penguin even if the cable disconnected or with noise added
